# Who am I?
Someone who explores the most random topics until they find their next obsession just so that they can ignore it after a month

# What do I do?
Basically anything and everything that interests me, until it doesn't

# Why do I do it?
I love crafting stories and experiences beyond what's possible in real life. This makes me chase after any medium that helps me say that story better. 

# Where to find me?
The obvious socials [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vaazhakola.exe/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vaazhakola) and [Reddit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

And maybe some less common ones [Behance](https://www.behance.net/adithyajayakum), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adijay/) and [Medium](https://adithyanjayakumar.medium.com/)
